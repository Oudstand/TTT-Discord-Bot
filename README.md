## 📋 Requirements

- **Garry's Mod** with **Trouble in Terrorist Town**
- **Discord Bot** (create one in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- **Steam API Key** from [steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)

---

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Discord Bot Setup

- Create a bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Add the bot to your server:
  - Go to the `OAuth2` tab
  - Under `OAuth2 URL Generator`, select `bot` under `SCOPES`
  - Under `BOT PERMISSIONS`, select `Send Messages` and `Mute Members`
  - Use the generated link to invite the bot to your server

### 2. Configuration (.env file)

Create a `.env` file (or rename the downloaded `.env.example`) and fill in your values:

```env
STEAM_API_KEY=your-steam-api-key
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token
GUILD_ID=1234567890
COMMAND_CHANNEL_ID=1234567890
STATS_CHANNEL_ID=1234567890
LANGUAGE=en
```

**Configuration values:**
- `STEAM_API_KEY`: Your Steam API key
- `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Your bot's token from the Discord Developer Portal
- `GUILD_ID`: Your Discord server ID
- `COMMAND_CHANNEL_ID`: Channel ID for the unmute button
- `STATS_CHANNEL_ID`: Channel ID for statistics messages
- `LANGUAGE`: Language for bot and dashboard (`en` for English, `de` for German)

### 3. Local Network Setup for GMod

To allow Garry's Mod to communicate with the bot, a special loopback address must be configured.

1. **Add IP address:** Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:
   ```bash
   netsh interface ipv4 add address "Loopback Pseudo-Interface 1" 192.178.0.1 255.255.255.255
   ```
2. **Edit hosts file:** Add the following line at the end of your hosts file (`C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`):
   ```
   192.178.0.1    ttthost
   ```

### 4. Install GMod Addons

Subscribe to the addons on Steam Workshop:

**[→ TTT Discord Bot on Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3601367840)** (required)
**[→ TTT Custom Names on Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3601388257)** (optional - for custom display names)

Alternatively, you can manually install the Lua files:
- **Discord Bot:** Move `lua-discord-bot/lua/autorun/server/discord_bot.lua` to:
  `<path-to-steam>\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\lua\autorun\server\discord_bot.lua`
- **Custom Names:** Move both files:
  - `lua-custom-names/lua/autorun/server/custom_names_server.lua` to:
    `<path-to-steam>\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\lua\autorun\server\custom_names_server.lua`
  - `lua-custom-names/lua/autorun/client/custom_names_client.lua` to:
    `<path-to-steam>\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\lua\autorun\client\custom_names_client.lua`

## 🔥 Running the Bot

### Using Pre-built Release (Recommended)

The easiest way to use the bot is to download the pre-built executable from GitHub Releases:

1. **Download:**
   - Go to [Releases](https://github.com/Oudstand/TTT-Discord-Bot/releases)
   - Download the latest `TTT Discord Bot.exe` and `.env.example`

2. **Setup:**
   - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in your configuration (Discord token, Steam API key, etc.)
   - Place the `.env` file in the same folder as the `.exe`

3. **Run:**
   - Double-click `TTT Discord Bot.exe`
   - The dashboard will open automatically at http://localhost:3000

**Language Selection:**
The dashboard opens in the language specified in your `.env` file (`LANGUAGE`). You can also manually change the language by adding `?lang=en` or `?lang=de` to the URL.

**Note:** The `.exe` is fully standalone and portable. Screenshot generation uses Microsoft Edge, which is pre-installed on Windows 10/11.

### Building from Source (Optional)

If you want to run the bot from source or build it yourself, follow these additional steps:

#### Requirements for Source Build

- **Bun:** Download and install Bun from the [official website](https://bun.sh/)

#### Download and Install

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Oudstand/TTT-Discord-Bot.git
   cd TTT-Discord-Bot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

#### Development Mode

Run the bot from source:

```bash
bun start
```

The dashboard will be available at http://localhost:3000.

#### Build Standalone .exe

To create your own portable `.exe` file:

```bash
bun run build
```

This creates `TTT Discord Bot.exe` in the project folder.
